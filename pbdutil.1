More than one type of data cannot be stored into Pasteboard.  For example,
when you copy a page from Safari, then Pasteboard contains both text and rtf
data.  But you cannot store both text and rtf data using pbdutil.  You can 
store only one type of data using pbdutil. 
.Pp
Private pasteboard created by issuing 'pbdutil -n name' cannot be removed.
\'pbdutil -n name -c' only clears the contents of the pasteboard.
