\fB"mkfw"\fR is a companion program that makes rtfd structured directory from the output of pbdutil.  If the Pasteboard contains data of RTFD type, you can use mkfw.
.\" .Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Sh EXAMPLES
To read and write data in Pasteboard: 
.Pp
.Dl "pbdutil -r tiff > /tmp/a.tiff"
.Dl "pabutil -w text < /etc/hosts
.Pp
To clear data in the Pasteboard:
.Pp
.Dl "pbdutil -c"
.Pp
To make rtfd structured directory that can be opend with TextEdit.app:
.Pp
.Dl "pbdutil -r rtfd | mkfw FILE.rtfd"
.Sh BUGS
There is no way to know private pastebords' names.
More than one type of data cannot be stored into Pasteboard.  For example,
when you copy a page from Safari, then Pasteboard contains both text and rtf
data.  But you cannot store both text and rtf data using pbdutil.  You can 
store only one type of data using pbdutil. 
.Pp
Private pasteboard created by issuing 'pbdutil -n name' cannot be removed.
\'pbdutil -n name -c' only clears the contents of the pasteboard.
